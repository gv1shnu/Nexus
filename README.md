# Nexus

Nexus is a web application that allows users to perform searches across multiple search engines simultaneously and view the results in one place.

## Features

- Perform searches across multiple search engines simultaneously.
- View search results from various search engines in one consolidated view.
- Experimental in nature.

## Usage

- Enter your search query in the search box in homepage.
- Press Enter to initiate the search.
- Search results from multiple search engines will be displayed within seconds.


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Search Nexus Flask application:

1. Clone the repository:
	
   		git clone https://github.com/gv1shnu/Nexus.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. To run this project, make sure you have Python 3.10 and pip installed on your system. Install the required dependencies:

## Limitations

- The search results may not always be consistent across different search engines due to variations in algorithms and indexing.
- The application relies on the availability of the search engines it queries and performance of the network.
- The application currently supports a predefined set of search engines and cannot dynamically add or remove search engines.
