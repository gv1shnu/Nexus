# Search Nexus

Search Nexus is a desktop/web application that allows users to perform searches across multiple search engines simultaneously and view the results in one place.

## Features

- Perform searches across multiple search engines simultaneously.
- View search results from various search engines in one consolidated view.
- Experimental in nature.

## Usage

- Enter your search query in the search box on the home page.
- Press Enter to initiate the search.
- Search results from multiple search engines will be displayed within seconds.

**Note**: Make sure Chrome is your default browser. It helps.

## Limitations

- The search results may not always be consistent across different search engines due to variations in algorithms and indexing.
- The application relies on the availability and performance of the search engines it queries.
- The application currently supports a predefined set of search engines and cannot dynamically add or remove search engines.
- I realize the repo is almost 47.97 MB now. I wonder how.
